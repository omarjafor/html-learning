        <p>Overview: <cite>The focus of this lab is to familiarize the student with the modulation and
        demodulation of an AM signal; prior knowledge of basic bipolar transistor theory is
        expected.
        An Amplitude Modulated signal is composed of both low frequency and high frequency
        components. The amplitude of the high frequency (carrier) of the signal is controlled by
        the low frequency (modulating) signal. The envelope of the signal is created by the low
        frequency signal. If the modulating signal is sinusoidal, then the envelope of the
        modulated Radio Frequency (RF) signal will also be sinusoidal. This would be the case
        in a common AM radio. The low frequency signal would be an audio signal and the high
        frequency would be the transmitting frequency of the AM radio station. Shown in Figure
        1 is an example of an AM signal in the time domain.</cite><br><br>
